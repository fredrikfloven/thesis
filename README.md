# Repo containing code and measurements for my thesis

## Code
The repo contains two projects, "Reagent-project" and "Re-Frame project".
Both implementations are written in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/index) and uses the [Reagent library](https://reagent-project.github.io/).
To run the application, some pre-requisites are required.

To run ClojureScript, instructions may be found [here](https://clojurescript.org/guides/quick-start).

The projects also use [Shadow-Cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) for hot-reloading and compilation.

### Reagent-project
This project was used to experiment on an application implemented with a relative state management model.

### Re-Frame-project
This project was used to experiment on an application implemented with a global state management model, using the framework [Re-Frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)

## Measurements
The measurements can be found in the following Google Sheet

[Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yiVsl_Y2awCgU4OIgjRv5PeZ5GI49no6QtyhuWMPRH4/edit?usp=sharing)

They were manually measured using Google's [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
